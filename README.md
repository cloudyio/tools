# ToolBox

## Youtube video downloader
Like the name suggests, allows you to get a raw stream of most youtube videos available to download.
Eventualy this project will eventually be a large set of tools you can use for free by self hosting or maybe hosted by me

## Features:
- adless
- modern ui
- easy to use
- customisable
- allows download of all available resolutions
- self hostable with no api keys

## Technologies
The app is built with 2 parts, the frontend and backend
### Front End
- SvelteKit
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI
- prettier

### Backend
- Flask
- pytubefix

### How to self host
1. Frontend is built with npm run build then can be run as a node app
2. Backend uses python, first libraries must be installed, then WSGI is reccomended but you can run with py main.py
